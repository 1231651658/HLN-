## Chapter 15

> “Has it any oceans?”
> “I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer.
> “Ah!” The little prince was disappointed. “Has it any mountains?”
> “I couldn’t tell you,” said the geographer.
> “And towns, and rivers, and deserts?”
> “I couldn’t tell you that, either.”
> “But you are a geographer!”
> “Exactly,” the geographer said. “But I am not an explorer. I haven’t a single explorer on my planet. It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts. The geographer is much too important to go loafing about. He does not leave his desk. But he receives the explorers in his study. He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels. And if the recollections  of  any  one  among  them  seem  interesting  to  him,  the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer’s moral character.”

It is none of my business.
